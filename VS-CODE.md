### IntelliSense for programming language
 IntelliSense is a general term used for variety of code editing features: code completion, parameter info, quick info, “code completion”, “content assist”, and “code hinting.”
 >VS Code IntelliSense is provided for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Less, and Sass out of the box. We can also add IntelliSense extension for other languages as well which are not supported by default.

 ### Command Palette:
 Visual studio supports inbuilt Integrated terminal, initially starting at the root of your opened project. This feature makes its very convenient as we don’t have to switch windows or alter the state of an existing terminal to perform a quick command line task.
 
 When we start typing any of these recognizable commands, the Command Palette provides IntelliSense help and even fires up the Command Prompt to execute tasks as shown in the following screenshot.
>You have to enter Command/Control+Shift+P to use this feature.

 ### Integrated Version Control (Built-in Git)
 Visual Studio Code has Git integration built-in, which makes it really easy to instantly see the changes you’re making in your project. On the left of the sidebar, we can find the Git icon where we can initialize Git as well as perform several Git commands such as  commit, pull, push, rebase, publish, and look into the changes within the file.
>VS Code works with any Git repository local or remote, and offers visual symbol to resolve conflicts before code commits.

### Debugging
One of the key features of Visual Studio Code is its great debugging support. VS Code’s built-in debugger helps accelerate your edit, compile and debug loop.  
>By default, it comes with support for NodeJS and can debug anything that is transpiled to JavaScript but other runtimes like C++ or Python will require an extension to be installed.
